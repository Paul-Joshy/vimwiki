=Linux=

Here you can find all the information that I have about
- The UNIX system
- The Linux kernel
- OS and distros
- CLI programs

There are some programs which will work on other systems also but most CLI non development programs are included here for now

- [[Partition|Standard linux partitioning]]
- [[CLI|command line programs]]
- [[Troubleshooting]]
